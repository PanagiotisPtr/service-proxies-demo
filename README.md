# Service Proxy Demo

This is a demo app that showcases using generated proxies for structs in Go to improve observability in a monolith app. 

## Layout

The layout is pretty straightforward. It's layered architecture with model/repo/service/app/controller and some other middleware and util stuff. I haven't done a lot of testing of the code so it's probably quite buggy. I'm just using it as an example.
